For example:

Input	Result

How many hours did you spend studying for the test?
25 hours is probably not enough!





#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a;
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("How many hours did you spend studying for the test?\n");
    if (a > 0 && a < 26)
    {
        printf("%d hours is probably not enough!\n", a);
    }
    else if (a > 40)
    {
        printf("Excellent, you should be well prepared for the test!");
    }
    if (a < 0)
    {
        printf("Invalid, you cannot have studied a negative number of hours!\n");
    }


}
