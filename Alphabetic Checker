For example:

Input	Result
f
Input a character:
The input was alphabetic.





#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char ch;
    printf("Input a character: \n");
    scanf("%c", &ch);

    if ((ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') || (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z')) {
        printf("The input was alphabetic.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The input was not alphabetic.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
