For example:

Input	Result
y
Did you score more than 50% in Practical Test 1 (y/n)?
Great! Hope you score well in Practical Test 2!





#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char response; 
    printf("Did you score more than 50%% in Practical Test 1 (y/n)?\n");
    scanf(" %c", &response); 

    if (response == 'Y' || response == 'y') {
        printf("Great! Hope you score well in Practical Test 2!\n");
    } else if (response == 'N' || response == 'n') {
        printf("Oh no! Hopefully your Practical Test 2 result is better!\n");
    } else {
        printf("Your response makes no sense!\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
